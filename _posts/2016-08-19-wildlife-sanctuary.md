# A Wildlife Sanctuary
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/befe6205-21f6-44fa-a02f-a488ed62d3c8.jpg)

Playa Escondida Lodge is also a spot to see a lot of wildlife from your front porch!

Pizotes and mapaches might sneak around the lodge during the day with their families, Pelicans fill up the sky in perfect flying alignments or diving into the ocean to fish their food, Whales can be spotted further on the orizon in season, and tucans, monkeys, iguanas, tons of birds, parrots, crickets, butterflies, (crabs..!) are all over the place.

The Reserve is kept mostly in Primary Forest and secondary forest, with annual reforestation of native woods in areas where older trees have fallen or hard jungle woods are rare.

The Jungle is home to a huge diversity of Flora and Fauna, untouched by visitors.
